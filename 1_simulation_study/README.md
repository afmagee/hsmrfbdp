# Simulations

## Software requirements
Simulating trees requires the R package TESS (version 3.0.0 or higher).
Using the R script to manage all analyses of simulated data requires the R package parallel (version 3.4.4 or higher, this comes with the base R installation).
Post-processing the simulation results requires the R package coda (version 0.19-3 or higher).
